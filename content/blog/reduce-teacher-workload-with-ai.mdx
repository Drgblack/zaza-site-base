# How to Reduce Teacher Workload with AI: Save 5+ Hours Per Week

Teacher burnout is at an all-time high. Between lesson planning, marking, reports, parent communications, and actual teaching, many educators are working 55+ hours per week. But **AI tools for teachers** are finally offering real solutions to **reduce teacher workload**.

As someone who's been in classrooms for 20+ years and now develops **safe AI for teachers**, I've seen firsthand how the right technology can give educators their lives back.

## The Teacher Workload Crisis: By the Numbers

Recent studies show UK teachers are spending:
- **11 hours per week** on planning and preparation
- **8 hours per week** on marking and feedback  
- **6 hours per week** on administrative tasks
- **4 hours per week** on parent communication and reports

**Total:** 29 hours of work beyond actual teaching time.

This isn't sustainable. And it's not necessary.

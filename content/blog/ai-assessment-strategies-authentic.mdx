## Subject-Specific Authentic Assessment Strategies

### Mathematics
**AI-Resistant Approaches**:
- Multi-step problems requiring strategic thinking
- Error analysis of AI-generated solutions
- Mathematical modeling of personally relevant scenarios
- Peer tutoring and explanation requirements

**Example Assessment**: 
"Design a budget plan for your ideal post-graduation year. Include housing, transportation, food, and entertainment costs for your specific location. Justify your choices with mathematical reasoning and present your plan to a panel of recent graduates."

### Science
**AI-Resistant Approaches**:
- Hands-on laboratory work with live observation
- Design challenges with physical constraints
- Local environmental investigation and data collection
- Science communication to non-expert audiences

**Example Assessment**:
"Investigate a water quality issue in your local area. Collect and analyze actual samples, research the causes, and present findings to your city council with specific recommendations for improvement."

### English Language Arts
**AI-Resistant Approaches**:
- Personal narrative with specific life experience integration
- Creative response to literature with original interpretation
- Socratic seminar participation and facilitation
- Multimedia storytelling with personal voice

**Example Assessment**:
"Create a multimedia presentation exploring how a character from our class novel would navigate a current challenge in your community. Include interviews with local community members and connections to your own experiences."

### Social Studies
**AI-Resistant Approaches**:
- Primary source analysis with personal interpretation
- Current events connection to historical patterns
- Community issue investigation and advocacy
- Perspective-taking with authentic historical voices

**Example Assessment**:
"Research a historical event using only primary sources available in our local archives. Present your findings as a documentary that includes interviews with local historians and connections to current community issues."

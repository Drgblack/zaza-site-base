# Trust First: A teacher's guide to safe, useful AI in the classroom

Parents, students, and colleagues will ask you about AI. Some are excited. Some are worried. Most are busy. This guide keeps it simple.

Start with trust, then use small, repeatable routines that actually help with teaching and learning. My PhD explored critical thinking and problem-solving in student-centred eLearning. The most useful lesson for classrooms is this: when we make thinking visible and lower cognitive load, students learn more.

AI can help, if we set the ground rules and keep humans in charge.

Below you will find a trust stack you can use tomorrow, ten quick wins that save time, low-prep routines that build thinking, and a one-page code of practice for your classroom. There is also a full 45-minute lesson ready to copy.

Everything is teacher-first, practical, and safe.

## What This Means for Teachers

> **From my research, translated for everyday teaching**
> - Authentic tasks with clear success criteria lead to better reasoning
> - Worked examples, then guided practice, then independence reduces cognitive load
> - Short, routine prompts about thinking improve explanations
> - Dialogue and rapid checks beat late, written comments
> - Feedback should change the next attempt, not only the grade

## 1) The Trust Stack: Policy to Practice

**Why this matters**  
Trust comes before tools. When students and families know the boundaries, your AI use becomes easier and safer.

**The stack in plain English**
1. **Policy** - follow school rules and local law
2. **Consent** - avoid pasting personal or sensitive data  
3. **Data minimisation** - share only what is needed for the task
4. **Audit trail** - keep simple notes or screenshots of prompts and outputs
5. **Human review** - you make the final decision

**Teacher micro-script**  
> "We will use AI to support learning. We will not paste personal details. I will check everything before we use it. If AI is wrong or biased, we will spot it together."

**Low-prep activity: Green, Amber, Red**  
Write three headings on the board: **Green** (safe to paste), **Amber** (check with teacher), **Red** (never paste). Students sort example snippets into the columns:

- **Green**: generic topic, success criteria, a model paragraph with no names
- **Amber**: paraphrase of a news story about the school  
- **Red**: student names, medical info, addresses, assessment data

**Quick check**  
Ask two students to explain why one example is Amber not Green, and how to make it Green.

## 2) What Is Safe to Do Now: 10 Quick Wins

Use these low-risk tasks to save time without touching sensitive data.

1. **Rewrite success criteria** in student-friendly language
2. **Generate three variant examples** at different levels  
3. **Create short hinge questions** for mid-lesson checks
4. **Turn a model answer** into a gap-fill scaffold
5. **Produce a short list** of misconceptions to watch for
6. **Draft a parent update** in a calm, professional tone
7. **Create exit ticket stems** that probe reasoning
8. **Turn feedback notes** into next-step prompts
9. **Translate a short class note** for parents, then review it
10. **Create a retrieval quiz** with 6 questions and answers

**Teacher micro-script**  
> "AI will help with the heavy lifting, not the thinking. We will use it to produce examples and check our criteria. We decide what is good enough."

**Low-prep activity: Example spread**  
Ask AI for three versions of an example answer: **Developing**, **Secure**, **Strong**. Display them. Students label the features that make each one better, then write one sentence to upgrade the Developing version.

**Quick check**  
Cold call two students: "What single change moves this from Developing to Secure?"

## 3) Low-Prep Routines That Build Thinking

AI should not replace thinking. It should make good thinking easier to teach.

### Routine A: CER Booster - Claim, Evidence, Reasoning
- **Purpose**: lift quality of explanations
- **Teacher micro-script**:  
  > "Write a clear claim. Add one piece of evidence. Explain why the evidence supports the claim."
- **Student action**: use a simple CER frame in pairs
- **Use AI for**: generating three candidate pieces of evidence to choose from
- **Quick check**: ask for one stronger piece of evidence and one clearer reasoning sentence

### Routine B: Worked-Example Remix
- **Purpose**: reduce cognitive load before independent work
- **Teacher micro-script**:  
  > "Study this model. With a partner, remove one hint and try the next question."
- **Student action**: apply the model and fade support
- **Use AI for**: creating the model and the next two similar questions
- **Quick check**: "Which hint can we remove next and why?"

### Routine C: Error Hunt
- **Purpose**: sharpen diagnostic thinking
- **Teacher micro-script**:  
  > "This answer looks confident but has two errors. Find and fix them."
- **Student action**: annotate and correct
- **Use AI for**: producing a plausible but flawed answer
- **Quick check**: "Name one error and explain the fix."

## 4) Your Classroom AI Code of Practice - One Page

Use or adapt this for your wall, your planner, and your parent notes.

### Our Class Code
- We use AI to save time and improve thinking
- We do not paste personal or sensitive data
- We check accuracy and bias
- We use success criteria and examples to guide quality
- We record key prompts and decisions in simple notes
- The final judgement is human

**Teacher micro-script**  
> "This is our code for safe, useful AI. If we are unsure, we stop and check. If the tool makes a mistake, we fix it."

**Low-prep activity: Scenario sort**  
Give three short scenarios. Students decide if each is **Go**, **Go with changes**, or **No Go**, then justify.

**Quick check**  
"Pick one No Go and tell me what change would make it safe enough."

## 5) A 45-Minute Lesson You Can Copy Tomorrow

**Topic example**: Building stronger explanations with CER using safe AI prompts.

**Materials**: projector or visualiser, mini whiteboards, timer.

### Whole Class Plan

**Minutes 0-5: Hook and Norms**  
Share the class code. Green-Amber-Red recap.  
**Micro-script**: "We will use AI to generate examples. We will check them carefully."

**Minutes 5-12: Model with Worked Example**  
Show a model explanation. Label Claim, Evidence, Reasoning.  
**Quick check**: students raise boards with C, E, R labels in the right places.

**Minutes 12-22: Example Spread**  
Use AI to produce Developing, Secure, Strong examples on the same prompt.  
Pairs highlight features and propose one upgrade for Developing.  
**Micro-script**: "Find one feature that improves clarity. Write a better sentence."

**Minutes 22-32: Guided Practice**  
Students write their own explanation with a prompt. Option to ask AI for three candidate evidence lines, then choose and justify.  
**Teacher move**: circulate, question for reasoning, collect live misconceptions.

**Minutes 32-40: Whole-Class Feedback**  
On the board: **What worked**, **Common fixes**, **Next step**.  
**Micro-script**: "Add one sentence that makes your reasoning clearer."

**Minutes 40-45: Exit Ticket**  
Students submit a 3-line CER. Teacher collects two samples for the next lesson.

### Years 5-6 Variant
- Use simpler topics, for example "Why plants need sunlight"
- Provide sentence stems: "I think...", "My evidence is...", "This shows..."
- Hinge question: "Which is stronger evidence and why?"

### Years 9-10 Variant
- Use subject prompts, for example "Explain why the character's decision changes the theme" or "Explain why resistance increases with wire length"
- Add one counter-example requirement for Strong level
- Hinge question: "What would change your claim?"

## 6) Mini-Rubric - Students Can Own It

### Uses Evidence
- **Novice**: picks any fact, limited link to claim
- **Secure**: picks relevant evidence and links it to the claim
- **Strong**: selects the most relevant evidence and justifies why it fits best

### Explains Reasoning
- **Novice**: repeats the claim or evidence
- **Secure**: explains how the evidence supports the claim
- **Strong**: explains the link and considers a counter or condition

## 7) Classroom Assets You Can Copy

### One-Page Checklist - Safe AI Quick Start
- Green-Amber-Red examples
- Ten quick wins list
- CER prompt stems
- Whole-class feedback template

### Short Script for Parents or Leaders
> "In our class we use AI to generate examples, rewrite criteria, and save time. We never paste personal information. Students still do the thinking. I review outputs before we use them, and I keep simple notes of the prompts we use. This reduces workload and improves the quality of student explanations."

## 8) How AI Helps Without Taking Over

Use **Zaza Promptly** to:
- **Tone and clarity** - rewrite success criteria and parent updates in plain, calm language
- **Example variants** - generate Developing, Secure, Strong versions for modelling and practice
- **Translation** - create a parent-friendly version in a requested language, then review it before sending

*Safety note*: always check accuracy and tone. Keep sensitive data out of prompts.

## Building Confidence with AI

The key to successful AI integration is starting small and building trust systematically. Choose one routine from this guide and use it consistently for a fortnight.

Students will initially be curious about AI capabilities. Channel this curiosity into learning about quality criteria and evidence evaluation rather than prompt engineering.

Parents and colleagues will have questions. The classroom code and parent script provide clear, professional responses that emphasise safety and educational value.

## Common Concerns and Responses

### "Won't students become dependent on AI?"
Not if we use it to generate examples and options rather than answers. Students still choose, evaluate, and justify their decisions.

### "How do I know AI outputs are accurate?"
You don't automatically. That's why human review is built into every routine. Checking AI becomes a valuable critical thinking skill.

### "What about academic integrity?"
Clear boundaries prevent problems. Students understand when AI helps with examples (permitted) versus when it completes their thinking (not permitted).

### "This seems like extra work"
Initially, yes. But these routines replace time-intensive activities like creating multiple examples or writing detailed feedback, creating net time savings.

## The Bigger Picture

AI in education isn't about replacing teachers or eliminating effort. It's about amplifying good teaching practices and reducing administrative load.

When we use AI to generate better examples, clarify success criteria, and provide varied practice opportunities, we enhance the conditions for learning rather than shortcutting the learning process.

The trust-first approach ensures that AI serves educational goals rather than driving them. Students learn to evaluate, select, and improve AI outputs, developing crucial 21st-century skills.

## Getting Started This Week

1. **Choose one quick win** from the list of ten and try it tomorrow
2. **Print the classroom code** and discuss it with your students
3. **Practice the Green-Amber-Red sorting** with a simple topic
4. **Keep notes** of what works and what needs adjustment

Remember: perfect isn't the goal. Progress is. Each small step builds confidence and competence with AI as a teaching tool.

Your students will benefit from better examples and clearer criteria. You'll benefit from reduced preparation time and more effective feedback routines.

## Looking Forward

AI capabilities will continue developing rapidly. The principles in this guide will remain constant: trust first, human judgement final, student thinking central.

Build habits now with simple, safe routines. When new AI capabilities emerge, you'll have the framework to evaluate and integrate them appropriately.

The goal isn't to use AI for everything. It's to use AI thoughtfully for tasks that genuinely improve teaching and learning while maintaining educational integrity.

# Teacher Self-Care Guide: Reclaim Your Time and Energy

*You're not just a teacher‚Äîyou're a human being who deserves to thrive, not just survive.*

## Why This Guide Matters

Teaching is one of the most demanding professions, yet self-care often feels like another item on an impossible to-do list. This guide isn't about bubble baths and meditation apps (though those can help). It's about creating realistic, sustainable practices that fit into your actual teaching life.

## 8. Safety Guidelines & Ethical Considerations

### Core Principles

1. **Student Privacy First**
   - Never input student names or personal details
   - Use generic descriptors (e.g., "Year 5 student")
   - Avoid identifying information

2. **Content Verification**
   - Always review AI-generated content
   - Check facts and accuracy
   - Ensure age-appropriateness
   - Verify curriculum alignment

3. **Professional Responsibility**
   - AI assists, doesn't replace professional judgment
   - Final decisions remain with the teacher
   - Maintain pedagogical expertise
   - Consider individual student needs

### Safe Prompting Practices

**DO:**
- Use general descriptions
- Focus on pedagogical strategies
- Ask for multiple options
- Request source citations when needed
- Test content before using with students

**DON'T:**
- Share personal student information
- Rely solely on AI for assessment decisions
- Use AI-generated content without review
- Share student work with AI systems
- Replace human connections with AI

### School Policy Compliance

**Check with your school about:**
- Approved AI tools
- Data privacy requirements
- Student information policies
- Assessment protocols
- Communication guidelines

## 9. Troubleshooting & Advanced Tips

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem:** AI responses are too generic
**Solution:** 
- Add more specific context
- Include age, ability level, subject details
- Specify format needed
- Give examples of desired output

**Problem:** Content doesn't match curriculum
**Solution:**
- Include specific curriculum standards
- Mention required skills/knowledge
- Reference specific frameworks
- Ask for alignment verification

**Problem:** Activities are too difficult/easy
**Solution:**
- Specify exact age and ability level
- Include prior knowledge context
- Request multiple difficulty versions
- Ask for scaffolding suggestions

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

**Chain Prompting:**
1. Start with broad concept generation
2. Refine specific elements
3. Create detailed implementation
4. Generate assessment tools

**Example Chain:**
```
1. "Create a unit on fractions for Year 4"
2. "Expand lesson 3 on equivalent fractions"
3. "Design hands-on activities for the equivalent fractions lesson"
4. "Create an assessment to check understanding of equivalent fractions"
```

**Iterative Improvement:**
```
"That's good, but can you:
- Make it more engaging
- Add visual elements
- Simplify the language
- Include more examples"
```

## Why Rubrics Transform Learning

When students understand the criteria for success before they begin, they can:
- **Self-monitor** their progress during the task
- **Set goals** for improvement in specific areas  
- **Peer assess** using shared understanding of quality
- **Take ownership** of their learning journey

## 4-Point Generic Rubric (copy & adapt)

This foundation rubric works across subjects and grade levels. Simply replace the criteria with subject-specific skills.

## Implementation Strategies

### Getting Started with Rubrics

1. **Introduce gradually** - Start with one simple rubric for familiar tasks
2. **Model evaluation** - Use exemplars to show each performance level
3. **Practice together** - Evaluate sample work as a class before independent use
4. **Student-friendly language** - Adapt vocabulary for your grade level
5. **Make it visual** - Use colors, icons, or symbols for younger students

### Self-Assessment Integration

**Before the Task:**
- Students read rubric and ask clarifying questions
- Provide examples at each performance level
- Students set personal goals using rubric criteria

**During the Task:**
- Students use rubric for self-monitoring
- Checkpoint conferences using rubric language
- Peer feedback based on specific criteria

**After the Task:**
- Students self-assess before submitting work
- Compare self-assessment with teacher evaluation
- Set goals for next similar task

### Efficient Grading with Rubrics

<div class="callout tip"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Focus on 2-3 criteria per assignment rather than overwhelming yourself or students with every category.</div>

**Color-coding system:**
- **Green highlight:** Exemplary (4)
- **Blue highlight:** Proficient (3)  
- **Yellow highlight:** Developing (2)
- **Pink highlight:** Beginning (1)

**Comment strategies:**
- Circle/highlight key phrases from rubric
- Add 1-2 specific examples as evidence
- Include one clear next step for improvement
- Use rubric language in report card comments

## Customization Guidelines

### Adapting for Grade Levels

**Primary (K-3):**
- Use 3-point scale instead of 4-point
- Include visual symbols (stars, traffic lights)
- Simplify language significantly
- Focus on effort and progress, not just achievement

**Elementary (4-6):**
- Include "I can" statements for each level
- Use student-friendly examples
- Build vocabulary gradually
- Include behavior/process criteria

**Middle/High School (7-12):**
- Include specific academic vocabulary
- Connect to standardized assessment criteria
- Include higher-order thinking skills
- Allow for self-selected criteria in some areas

### Subject-Specific Adaptations

**Language Arts:** Include creativity, voice, and audience awareness
**Mathematics:** Emphasize reasoning, communication, and problem-solving process  
**Science:** Focus on inquiry skills, scientific thinking, and communication
**Social Studies:** Include perspective-taking, source evaluation, and connections
**Arts:** Emphasize creativity, technique, and personal expression

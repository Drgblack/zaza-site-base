> "Assessment **for** learning, not **of** learning."  
> This checklist provides immediate strategies to check understanding and adjust instruction.

<div class="callout tip"><strong>Quick Start:</strong> Choose 3-4 techniques to try this week. Build habits gradually rather than overwhelming yourself with too many new strategies.</div>

## What Makes Formative Assessment Effective

### Core Principles
- **Immediate:** Provides real-time feedback
- **Actionable:** Results inform next instructional steps
- **Low-stakes:** No grades, just learning information
- **Student-friendly:** Helps learners understand their progress
- **Efficient:** Quick to implement and analyze

### The Assessment Cycle
1. **Plan:** Choose technique based on learning objective
2. **Implement:** Use during or right after instruction
3. **Analyze:** Look for patterns in responses
4. **Adjust:** Modify teaching based on results
5. **Follow-up:** Check if adjustments helped

## Quick Check Techniques (0-5 minutes)

### ✓ Thumbs Up/Down/Sideways
**When to use:** After explaining a concept  
**How:** Students show thumbs up (got it), down (confused), sideways (sort of)  
**Next steps:** Thumbs down → reteach differently; Sideways → provide examples

### ✓ Exit Tickets
**When to use:** Last 3 minutes of class  
**How:** One question on paper or digital platform  
**Sample questions:**
- "What's one thing you learned today?"
- "What's still confusing?"
- "Rate your confidence 1-5 and explain why"

### ✓ Fist to Five
**When to use:** Check confidence levels  
**How:** 0 fingers (no understanding) to 5 fingers (could teach someone else)  
**Follow-up:** 0-2 need reteaching; 3-4 need practice; 5 can peer tutor

### ✓ One Word Summary
**When to use:** End of lesson or unit  
**How:** Students write one word that captures the main idea  
**Analysis:** Look for patterns, misconceptions, or gaps

### ✓ 3-2-1 Reflection
**Format:**
- 3 things I learned
- 2 things I found interesting  
- 1 question I still have

### ✓ Think-Pair-Share Response
**Steps:**
1. Pose question (30 seconds thinking)
2. Share with partner (2 minutes)
3. Listen to sample responses
4. Note common misconceptions

## Observation Strategies

### ✓ Gallery Walk
**Setup:** Post student work around room  
**Process:** Students view work, leave feedback on sticky notes  
**Teacher role:** Observe discussions, note common errors

### ✓ Traffic Light Self-Assessment
**Red:** I don't understand and need help  
**Yellow:** I'm getting there but need practice  
**Green:** I understand and can help others

**Implementation:** Use colored cards, digital polls, or hand signals

### ✓ Learning Stations Monitoring
**Strategy:** Rotate through stations during independent work  
**Focus areas:**
- Who's struggling with which concepts?
- What questions keep coming up?
- Which students can peer tutor?

### ✓ Strategic Questioning
Instead of "Any questions?" try:
- "What questions do you have?"
- "Which part needs more explanation?"
- "Who can explain this in their own words?"

## Digital Tools & Techniques

### ✓ Real-Time Polling
**Tools:** Mentimeter, Poll Everywhere, Kahoot  
**Best for:** Multiple choice, true/false, word clouds  
**Advantage:** Anonymous responses increase participation

### ✓ Digital Exit Tickets
**Tools:** Google Forms, Padlet, Flipgrid  
**Questions to try:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you with today's objective?"
- "What would you like more practice with?"
- "Explain today's concept to a friend in one sentence"

### ✓ Collaborative Documents
**Platform:** Google Docs, Padlet, Jamboard  
**Use:** Students add responses to shared document  
**Monitor:** Watch entries in real-time, identify patterns

### ✓ Quick Quizzes
**Tools:** Quizizz, Blooket, Gimkit  
**Format:** 3-5 questions, immediate results  
**Focus:** Current lesson objectives, not cumulative content

## Subject-Specific Strategies

### Mathematics

#### ✓ Show Your Work Checks
- Circulate during problem-solving
- Look for process, not just answers
- Note common calculation errors

#### ✓ Math Talk Protocols
- "I agree/disagree because..."
- "I'd like to add to ___'s idea..."
- "Can you explain your thinking?"

#### ✓ Error Analysis
Present incorrect solution, ask students to find and fix mistakes

#### ✓ Number Line Strategies
Students place their confidence on a number line (0-10)

### Science

#### ✓ Predict-Observe-Explain
Before demonstrations:
1. Students predict outcomes
2. Observe what happens
3. Explain discrepancies

#### ✓ Concept Sketching
Draw and label scientific processes or structures

#### ✓ Hypothesis Testing
Quick experiments with immediate result analysis

#### ✓ Science Talks
"What do you notice?" and "What makes you say that?"

### Language Arts

#### ✓ Reading Comprehension Checks
- Summarize paragraph in 10 words
- Predict what happens next
- Identify main idea vs. details

#### ✓ Writing Process Checks
- Beginning, middle, end assessment
- Peer feedback protocols
- Self-editing checklists

#### ✓ Vocabulary Checks
- Use new word in a sentence
- Draw the word's meaning
- Connect to personal experience

#### ✓ Discussion Protocols
- Turn and talk stems
- Building on others' ideas
- Asking clarifying questions

### Social Studies

#### ✓ Perspective Taking
"How might _____ view this event?"

#### ✓ Cause and Effect Mapping
Quick graphic organizers during content delivery

#### ✓ Current Connections
"How does this relate to today?"

#### ✓ Timeline Positioning
Place events or concepts on class timeline

### Making Data Actionable

#### Same Day Adjustments
- **High confusion:** Stop and reteach differently
- **Mixed understanding:** Pair strong with struggling students  
- **Most understand:** Move forward, provide extension

#### Next Lesson Planning
- **Common misconceptions:** Address explicitly

- **Extension groups:** Students ready for challenge

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Students won't respond honestly"
**Solutions:**
- Emphasize no grades attached
- Use anonymous digital tools
- Model that confusion is normal
- Celebrate questions as learning opportunities

### "Takes too much time"
**Solutions:**
- Start with 30-second techniques
- Use digital tools for instant collection
- Incorporate into existing routines
- Focus on one technique until automatic

### "Don't know what to do with information"
**Solutions:**
- Plan 2-3 response options in advance
- Use simple tracking systems
- Focus on patterns, not individual responses
- Start small with obvious next steps

### "Students give expected answers"
**Solutions:**
- Use varied question formats
- Ask for explanations, not just answers

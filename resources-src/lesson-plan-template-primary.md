### The Gradual Release Model

Primary lessons work best when they follow the "I Do, We Do, You Do" progression that builds student independence systematically.

| Phase | Purpose | Teacher Role | Student Role | Duration |
|-------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Hook** | Engage and activate | Facilitator | Active participant | 5-8 min |
| **I Do** | Model and demonstrate | Instructor | Observer/questioner | 10-15 min |
| **We Do** | Guide practice | Coach/supporter | Guided participant | 15-20 min |
| **You Do** | Independent practice | Monitor/feedback | Independent worker | 15-20 min |
| **Wrap-Up** | Assess and reflect | Evaluator | Self-assessor | 5-10 min |

```

**Example Hooks by Subject:**

| Subject | Hook Example |
|---------|--------------|
| **Math** | "If every student in our school gave me 5 cents, how much money would I have?" |
| **Reading** | Show book cover: "What do you predict this story will be about based on these clues?" |
| **Science** | Demonstrate simple experiment: "Watch this. What do you think will happen and why?" |
| **Social Studies** | "Imagine you could only pack 3 things for a long journey. What would you choose?" |

### 2. Learning Intention & Success Criteria (2-3 minutes)

**Student-Friendly Language:**

**We Do (18 min):** Solve 3 problems together, with students using manipulatives while teacher demonstrates on board.

**You Do (20 min):** Students complete 6 problems independently, choosing between blocks, drawings, or algorithms.

**Closure (5 min):** Exit ticket with one problem and explanation: "Solve 47 + 25 and explain your thinking."

### Reading Example: Character Traits (Grade 3)

**Learning Objective:** Students will identify character traits using evidence from the text.

**Hook (6 min):** Show photos of community helpers. "What words describe these people? How do you know?" Create word web.

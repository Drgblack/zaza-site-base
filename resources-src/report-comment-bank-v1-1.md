<div class="badges"><span class="badge">assessment</span><span class="badge">v1.1</span><span class="badge">EN</span></div>

<div class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep to 70–110 words. One strength, one target, one action.</div>

> "Good report comments tell a story: Here's what I saw, here's what it means, here's where we're going next."

## The E-I-N Framework

Every effective report comment follows this structure:

| Component | Purpose | Example Phrases |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Evidence** | What you observed | "Consistently demonstrates..." "Accurately completed..." "Confidently explains..." |
| **Impact** | What this shows about learning | "This shows..." "Demonstrates..." "Indicates developing..." |
| **Next** | Specific next steps | "Moving forward..." "Next term focus..." "To continue growing..." |

<div class="callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> Use student's name 1-2 times maximum per comment to maintain personal connection without repetition.</div>

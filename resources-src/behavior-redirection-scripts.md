Transform challenging moments into learning opportunities with research-backed scripts that redirect behavior while preserving student dignity and strengthening relationships.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Core Principle:</strong> Every redirection should teach appropriate behavior while maintaining the student's sense of belonging and capability.
</div>

## The Science of Effective Redirection

Effective behavior redirection works because it addresses the underlying needs driving the behavior while teaching more appropriate ways to meet those needs.

### Why Scripts Matter

<div class="kv">
  <div>**Consistency**</div><div>All students receive fair, predictable responses</div>
  <div>**Relationship Preservation**</div><div>Language stays respectful even under pressure</div>
  <div>**Teaching Focus**</div><div>Redirections become learning opportunities</div>
  <div>**De-escalation**</div><div>Calm, neutral tone prevents power struggles</div>
</div>

### The CARE Framework for Redirection

Every effective redirection follows this pattern:

1. **C**alm presence and neutral tone
2. **A**cknowledge the student's experience or need
3. **R**edirect to appropriate behavior with clear expectations
4. **E**ngage the student in problem-solving when appropriate

## Universal Redirection Scripts

These foundational scripts work across age groups with minor language adjustments.

### The Gentle Redirect

*Use when:* Student is off-task but not disruptive

**Script:** "I notice you're [describe what you see]. Right now, we need [specific expectation]. Can you show me [desired behavior]?"

**Example:** "I notice you're drawing in your notebook. Right now, we need everyone listening to the directions. Can you show me your ready position?"

**Why it works:** Acknowledges without judgment, provides clear expectation, invites compliance.

### The Choice Redirect

*Use when:* Student needs autonomy to comply

**Script:** "You have a choice right now. You can [appropriate option 1] or [appropriate option 2]. Which would work better for you?"

**Example:** "You have a choice right now. You can move to the quiet space to finish your work, or you can stay here and use your inside voice. Which would work better for you?"

**Why it works:** Provides control within appropriate boundaries, teaches decision-making.

### The Proximity Redirect

*Use when:* Student needs support to self-regulate

**Script:** *[Move closer, lower voice]* "I'm here to help. What do you need right now to be successful?"

**Example:** *[Stand next to student]* "I'm here to help. What do you need right now to focus on your math?"

**Why it works:** Offers support without criticism, invites student to identify their needs.

## Situation-Specific Scripts

### Attention-Seeking Behaviors

**When student calls out or interrupts:**

*Elementary Script:* "I can see you have something important to share. Use our signal [hand up/quiet hand] and I'll call on you."

*Secondary Script:* "I can hear you have thoughts about this. Please use our discussion protocol so everyone can participate."

**When student makes inappropriate jokes or comments:**

*Elementary Script:* "That's not the kind of humor that helps our class feel safe. Try again with words that build people up."

*Secondary Script:* "I need comments that move our learning forward. Can you rephrase that to contribute to our discussion?"

### Work Avoidance Behaviors

**When student says "This is too hard" or "I can't do this":**

*Universal Script:* "I hear that this feels challenging right now. Let's break it into smaller pieces. What's the first step you can try?"

**When student rushes through work carelessly:**

*Elementary Script:* "I can see you want to finish quickly. Let's look at our quality checklist first. Which part needs more attention?"

*Secondary Script:* "I notice you're working quickly. Let's pause and check this against our success criteria. What would make this stronger?"

**When student refuses to start work:**

*Universal Script:* "I see you haven't started yet. Help me understand what's in the way. What would help you take the first step?"

### Social Conflict Scripts

**When students argue or have peer conflicts:**

*Elementary Script:* "I can see you both have strong feelings about this. Let's pause and use our problem-solving steps. [Name], what happened first?"

*Secondary Script:* "I can see this is important to both of you. Let's take a step back and work through this respectfully. What's the main issue here?"

**When student excludes or is unkind to peers:**

*Elementary Script:* "I heard words that hurt [Name]'s feelings. In our class, we use words that help people feel included. How can you repair this?"

*Secondary Script:* "I noticed that interaction left [Name] feeling excluded. Let's think about how to rebuild this relationship. What's a better approach?"

## De-escalation Scripts

### When Student is Frustrated or Angry

**Level 1: Early Signs**
*Script:* "I can see you're getting frustrated. Let's take a moment. What would help you feel calmer?"

*Alternative:* "I notice your body language is telling me this is hard right now. Would you like to take some deep breaths with me?"

**Level 2: Escalating**
*Script:* "You seem really upset right now. Let's find a way to help you feel better. Would you like to [walk with me/sit in the calm corner/take a break]?"

*Alternative:* "This is feeling big right now. I'm going to stay here with you until you're ready. You're safe."

**Level 3: Highly Escalated**
*Script:* "I can see you're having a really hard time right now. I'm here when you're ready. You don't have to do anything except breathe."

*Follow-up:* "That was a big feeling. You handled it as best you could. When you're ready, let's talk about what might help next time."

### When Student Shuts Down

**Script:** "I notice you're feeling overwhelmed right now. That's okay. I'm going to give you some quiet time, and I'll check back in a few minutes."

**Check-in Script:** "I'm checking in to see how you're doing. No pressure to talk, but I want you to know I'm here."

**Re-engagement Script:** "When you're ready to try again, I'm here to help. There's no rush."

## Defiance and Power Struggle Scripts

### When Student Refuses to Follow Direction

**Avoid:** "You need to do this right now" or "Because I said so"

**Instead:** "I can see you don't want to [specific behavior] right now. Help me understand what's making this difficult."

**Follow-up:** "What would make this work better for you while still [meeting the expectation]?"

### When Student Talks Back or is Disrespectful

**Avoid:** Getting into argument or taking it personally

**Script:** "I can hear you're upset, and that's okay. The way you're expressing it isn't working for our classroom. Let's try again."

**If it continues:** "I can see you need some time to calm down. Let's take a break and talk about this when we're both ready."

### When Student Tests Boundaries

**Script:** "I notice you're testing our class agreements right now. These expectations help everyone feel safe and learn well. Let's get back on track."

**Persistent testing:** "I can see you're having trouble with our expectations today. What do you think would help you be successful?"

## Age-Specific Adaptations

### Early Elementary (K-2)

Use simpler language and more physical comfort:

- "Your body is telling me you need a break. Let's find a calm spot."
- "I can see big feelings. Let me help you feel better."
- "That choice didn't work. Let's try a different choice."

### Upper Elementary (3-5)

Include more problem-solving and autonomy:

- "I notice you're struggling with this expectation. What strategy could you try?"
- "This behavior isn't matching our class values. How can you get back on track?"
- "I can see you need something different right now. What would help?"

### Middle School (6-8)

Acknowledge growing independence and emotional complexity:

- "I can see this is frustrating for you. Let's figure out a solution together."
- "This approach isn't working for you right now. What would be more effective?"
- "I notice you're having a hard time today. How can I support you?"

### High School (9-12)

Treat as emerging adults with respect for their developing identity:

- "I can see you have concerns about this expectation. Let's discuss what would work better."
- "This situation needs a different approach. What are your thoughts on how to move forward?"
- "I notice you're struggling with this. What support would be helpful?"

## Follow-Up and Restoration Scripts

### After a Difficult Moment

**Immediate Follow-up (same day):**
*Script:* "I wanted to check in about what happened earlier. How are you feeling now?"

**Restoration Conversation:**
*Script:* "Let's talk about what happened and how we can make things right. What do you think went wrong?"

**Moving Forward:**
*Script:* "Everyone has hard moments. What I care about is how we learn from this. What could you try differently next time?"

### When Apologies are Needed

**Teaching Meaningful Apology:**
*Script:* "A real apology has three parts: what you did, how it affected others, and how you'll do better. Can you try that?"

**If Student Resists Apologizing:**
*Script:* "You don't have to apologize right now. But you do need to repair the relationship. What's one way you could do that?"

## Preventing Common Mistakes

### What NOT to Say

<div class="callout warn">
  <strong>Avoid These Phrases:</strong>
  - "You always..." or "You never..."
  - "What's wrong with you?"
  - "I'm disappointed in you"
  - "You should know better"
  - "Other kids don't do this"
</div>

### Instead, Try These Approaches

| Avoid | Try Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Stop that right now!" | "I need you to [specific behavior]. Can you show me that?" |
| "You're being disrespectful" | "That tone isn't working for our classroom. Can you try again?" |
| "Pay attention!" | "I need your eyes up here and your body ready to learn" |
| "You're making bad choices" | "That choice isn't working. What would be a better choice?" |

## Cultural Responsiveness in Redirection

### Understanding Different Perspectives

Remember that behavior norms vary across cultures:

- **Eye contact:** Some cultures teach children not to make direct eye contact with authority figures
- **Voice volume:** What seems "too loud" or "too quiet" may be cultural communication style
- **Personal space:** Comfort with proximity varies significantly
- **Response to authority:** Some cultures emphasize different forms of respect

### Culturally Responsive Scripts

**When cultural differences may be involved:**
*Script:* "I can see we might have different ideas about [behavior]. In our classroom, we [expectation] because [reason]. How can we make this work for you?"

**Building understanding:**
*Script:* "Help me understand how things work in your family/culture. Let's figure out how to honor that while meeting our classroom needs."

## Implementation Strategies

### Practice Makes Perfect

<div class="kv">
  <div>**Role-Play**</div><div>Practice scripts with colleagues before challenging situations arise</div>
  <div>**Record Yourself**</div><div>Listen to your tone and pacing to refine delivery</div>
  <div>**Start Small**</div><div>Choose 3-5 scripts to master before adding more</div>
  <div>**Reflect Daily**</div><div>Note which scripts worked and adjust for next time</div>
</div>

### Building Your Redirection Toolkit

1. **Choose your top 5** most common behavior challenges
2. **Select matching scripts** and customize for your voice
3. **Practice delivery** with neutral, caring tone
4. **Use consistently** to build student familiarity
5. **Reflect and adjust** based on student responses

Remember: The goal isn't perfect behavior, but helping students learn better ways to express their needs and navigate social situations. Your calm, consistent responses teach them that they are worthy of respect even when they struggle.

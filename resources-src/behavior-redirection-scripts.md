## In-class scripts
- **Low-level chatter:** "Voices at level 1. If you're finished, start the next step."  
- **Off-task:** "Right now the expectation is ____. Show me you're ready by ____."  
- **Refocus break:** "Take two minutes at the reset spot; then rejoin and try again."

## Family note micro-templates
- *Celebration:* "{{Student}} supported a classmate today by {{action}}—we're proud!"  
- *Follow-up:* "We practiced a quick reset routine to help with focus. At home, please review the ready-to-learn checklist."

<div class="badges"><span class="badge">communication</span><span class="badge">v1.1</span><span class="badge">EN</span></div>

> "I know what to say—**finding the words** takes forever."  
> This pack gives you ready-to-send drafts and tone-safe phrasing.

<div class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep emails 120–180 words. Lead with the win, end with a clear next step.</div>

## How this pack works
1. Pick a **template** that fits the situation.  
2. Personalize the **specifics** (student, date, evidence).  
3. Choose a **closer** that matches tone.  
4. (Optional) Use **AI Assist** prompts to refine.

### Tone Ladder (choose one)
- **Warm:** "I appreciate how you've been supporting…"  
- **Neutral–professional:** "I'm writing to share an update regarding…"  
- **Firm but kind:** "To support {{Student}}, we need a consistent routine at home and school…"

## Core templates

### Positive update
**Subject:** A quick positive note about {{Student}}  
Hi {{Parent/Carer}},  
{{Student}} showed great progress in {{topic}} today—specifically {{evidence}}.  
This matters because {{impact}}.  
**Next step:** We'll keep practicing {{strategy}}; a quick encouragement at home would help.  
*Thanks for your support,*  
{{Teacher}}, {{Class/Year}}

**Example in action:**
> **Subject:** A quick positive note about Emma  
> Hi Ms. Johnson,  
> Emma showed great progress in reading comprehension today—specifically, she made three text-to-self connections during our discussion of "Wonder" and explained her thinking clearly to the group.  
> This matters because she's building the critical thinking skills that will serve her across all subjects.  
> **Next step:** We'll keep practicing making connections; asking "Does this remind you of anything?" during bedtime stories would help reinforce this skill.  
> *Thanks for your support,*  
> Ms. Rodriguez, Year 5

### General progress
**Subject:** Update on {{Student}}'s learning in {{subject}}  
Hello {{Parent/Carer}},  
I wanted to update you on {{Student}}'s recent work in {{unit}}. I've seen {{evidence}}.  
This shows {{impact}}.  
**Next step:** We'll focus on {{target}}; at home, a short {{activity}} 2–3 times per week would be ideal.  
*Warm regards,* {{Teacher}}

**Example in action:**
> **Subject:** Update on Marcus's learning in mathematics  
> Hello Mr. and Mrs. Chen,  
> I wanted to update you on Marcus's recent work in fractions. I've seen him successfully comparing fractions with different denominators using visual models and explaining his reasoning to classmates.  
> This shows he's developing strong conceptual understanding alongside procedural skills.  
> **Next step:** We'll focus on adding fractions with unlike denominators; having him help with cooking measurements 2–3 times per week would be ideal practice.  
> *Warm regards,* Mr. Thompson

## Tricky scenarios (copy, paste, personalize)

### Late / incomplete work (supportive)
**Subject:** Supporting {{Student}} with work completion  
Hi {{Parent/Carer}},  
I've noticed {{Student}} has been finding it challenging to complete {{assignments}} consistently. Rather than focusing on what's not working, let's build a system that sets them up for success.

**At school, we'll:**
1. Start with a 5-minute setup checklist
2. Break tasks into smaller chunks with checkpoints
3. Provide a quick teacher check-in halfway through

**At home support:** Could you help by reviewing the checklist each evening? I'll share a one-page version that takes just 2 minutes to complete together.

This collaborative approach helps {{Student}} develop independence while feeling supported.

*Let's connect on {{day}} to see how it's going,*  
{{Teacher}}

**What I'm seeing:** {{Student}} sometimes struggles with {{specific behavior}} during {{context}}. This often happens when {{possible trigger}}.

**Our classroom plan:**
- Use a short reset strategy (2-minute timer + quiet movement)
- Practice "ready to learn" routines during calm moments
- Celebrate small wins consistently

**Your insight needed:** What approaches work well at home when {{Student}} feels overwhelmed? We'd love to mirror successful strategies.

*Looking forward to partnering with you,*  
{{Teacher}}

### Sensitive hygiene (discreet)
**Subject:** Confidential note about {{Student}}  
Dear {{Parent/Carer}},  
I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out privately about a sensitive matter regarding {{Student}}.

We've noticed that {{Student}} may benefit from a gentle reminder about {{hygiene topic}} before school. This is completely normal for students this age, and we want to address it discretely to support their confidence with peers.

**Our approach:** We'll support {{Student}} quietly at school with subtle reminders and access to supplies if needed.

**Home support:** A simple morning checklist might help establish routines. Happy to suggest specific strategies if that would be helpful.

Please know this comes from a place of care for {{Student}}'s wellbeing and social confidence.

*Warm regards,*  
{{Teacher}}

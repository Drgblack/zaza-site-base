# Teacher AI Toolkit
<div class="title"><div class="subtitle">Essential AI tools and prompts to enhance teaching efficiency and student outcomes.</div></div>
<div class="badges"><span class="badge">ai-tools</span><span class="badge">v1.1</span><span class="badge">EN</span></div>

> "AI doesn't replace teachersâ€”it **amplifies** great teaching."  
> This toolkit provides practical, tested prompts to save time and improve outcomes.

<div class="callout tip"><strong>Quick Start:</strong> Begin with lesson planning prompts, then gradually explore grading and communication tools as you build confidence.</div>

## How to use this toolkit

### Getting Started
1. **Choose your AI platform** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or similar)
2. **Copy and paste** the prompts exactly as written
3. **Replace placeholders** ({{subject}}, {{grade level}}, etc.) with your specifics
4. **Refine the output** by asking follow-up questions
5. **Save successful prompts** for reuse

### Prompt Structure
All prompts follow this pattern:
- **Context:** Role and objective
- **Specifics:** Subject, grade level, constraints
- **Output format:** Exactly what you need
- **Quality criteria:** Standards for the response

## Lesson Planning & Curriculum

### Comprehensive Lesson Plans

**Subject:** Create detailed lesson plan for {{topic}} for {{grade level}}

- Materials needed
- Step-by-step activities with timing
- Differentiation strategies
- Assessment methods
- Extension activities

Format as a structured plan that another teacher could follow exactly.
```

## Time-Saving Workflows

### Batch Processing

<div class="callout note"><strong>Efficiency Tip:</strong> Group similar tasks together. Grade all math homework at once, write all parent emails in one session, plan all science lessons for the week together.</div>

1. **Lesson Planning Batch:**
   - Set aside 2-3 hours weekly
   - Plan entire week at once
   - Use templates for consistency
   - Save successful prompts

2. **Grading Batch:**
   - Grade same assignment across all classes
   - Use voice-to-text for feedback
   - Create rubrics with AI first
   - Set timer for each paper

3. **Communication Batch:**
   - Answer all emails once daily
   - Write parent updates weekly
   - Use templates with personal touches
   - Schedule send for appropriate times

### Quality Control

Before using any AI-generated content:

- [ ] **Accuracy check:** Verify facts and concepts
- [ ] **Age appropriateness:** Suitable for your students
- [ ] **Alignment:** Matches your learning objectives  
- [ ] **Voice:** Sounds like you, not a robot
- [ ] **Completeness:** Includes all necessary elements
- [ ] **Safety:** No inappropriate content or bias

## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Chaining

Break complex tasks into steps:

1. **Generate outline** â†’ Review and refine
2. **Develop details** â†’ Add specifics  
3. **Create materials** â†’ Make worksheets/slides
4. **Plan assessment** â†’ Design evaluation

### Context Building

Improve results by providing context:
- Your teaching style
- Student characteristics  
- School constraints
- Available resources
- Time limitations

### Iteration Strategy

1. Start with basic prompt
2. Review initial output
3. Ask for specific improvements
4. Refine until satisfied
5. Save successful versions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Generic Responses
**Problem:** AI gives vague, textbook answers  
**Solution:** Add specific constraints, examples, and context

### Inappropriate Content
**Problem:** Content doesn't match your students  
**Solution:** Specify grade level, reading level, cultural considerations

### Wrong Format
**Problem:** Output isn't in usable format  
**Solution:** Be explicit about desired structure and format

### Missing Key Elements
**Problem:** AI skips important components  
**Solution:** Use checklists in your prompts

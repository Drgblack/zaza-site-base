## Tone & posture
- Voice: **calm, low, brief**
- Stance: **side-on**, give space; eye level or lower
- Choice: **what to do**, not what **not** to do

## Quick scripts (swap names as needed)
- **Off-task talking:**  
  "Sam, pause there. **Back on the question in row 2.** I'll check in one minute."
- **Calling out:**  
  "Taylor, **hands up to contribute**. I'll come to you next."
- **Refusal:**  
  "Jordan, this is tough. **Start with the first step**—I'll help with the second."
- **Wandering:**  
  "Casey, **back to seat**. Pick up where you left off here."
- **Low-level disruption:**  
  "Team, **voices to level 1**. We need 3 quiet minutes to finish."

## Reset routine (30–60s)
1. Name the goal: "We need quiet to hear instructions."  
2. Specific ask: "**Pens down, eyes front**."  
3. Check & praise: "Thanks—most are ready. **Waiting on two… now all ready.**"

> **Consistency beats volume.** Scripts + calm repetition = strong culture.

## Parent line for follow-up (short)
"Hello [Name], just a quick note: we had difficulty staying focused today, and we've agreed [Student] will try [strategy] tomorrow. I'll keep you posted."

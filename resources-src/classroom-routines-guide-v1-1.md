## The Science of Classroom Routines

### Why Routines Matter

**For Students:**
- Reduce cognitive load (brain power saved for learning)
- Increase sense of safety and predictability
- Build independence and responsibility
- Create equity (everyone knows expectations)

**For Teachers:**
- Save time on transitions and management
- Reduce decision fatigue
- Prevent behavioral issues before they start
- Create consistent learning environment

### Routine vs. Procedure
- **Routine:** Automatic behavior (students do without prompting)
- **Procedure:** Step-by-step process being learned

**Goal:** Transform procedures into routines through consistent practice

## Foundation Routines (Week 1-2)

### Morning Entry Routine

**The Challenge:** Students enter chaotically, day starts with confusion

**The Routine:**
1. **Silent entry** (first 5 minutes)
2. **Unpack systematically** (backpack → homework → supplies)
3. **Check morning message** (on board or screen)
4. **Begin bell work** (review or preview activity)
5. **Teacher circulates** (greets students, checks homework)

**Teaching Tips:**
- Practice for 3-5 days explicitly
- Use timer and gentle reminders
- Celebrate successful mornings
- Address problems privately, not publicly

**Sample Morning Message:**
```
Good morning, Room 12!
Today is Tuesday, October 15th
We'll explore fractions in math
Remember: Science project due Friday
Please complete problems 1-5 in your math journal
```

### Attention Signal

**The Challenge:** Getting 25+ students quiet quickly

**Options That Work:**

#### Clap Pattern
- Teacher claps rhythm
- Students clap back and freeze
- Escalate complexity if needed

#### Countdown
- "5 - finish your sentence"
- "4 - eyes on me"  
- "3 - hands empty"
- "2 - bodies still"
- "1 - ready to learn"

#### Call and Response
- Teacher: "Criss-cross"
- Students: "Apple sauce" (and sit properly)

**Implementation:**
- Choose ONE method, stick with it
- Practice when students aren't excited
- Wait for 100% compliance before continuing
- Thank students for quick response

### Dismissal Routine

**The Challenge:** Ending class calmly and organized

**The Routine:**
1. **Two-minute warning** (finish current task)
2. **Pack up procedure** (books first, then supplies)
3. **Chair placement** (push in or stack)
4. **Ready position** (hands folded, eyes forward)
5. **Dismiss by rows/groups** (not all at once)

**Key Points:**
- Never dismiss during chaos
- Students earn dismissal through calm behavior
- Pack up time is silent or very quiet
- Release students only when ready

## Instructional Routines (Week 3-4)

### Transition Between Activities

**The Magic Window:** Most disruptions happen during transitions

**The 3-Step Transition:**
1. **Close current activity** (clear instruction about stopping)
2. **Prepare for next** (get materials, move if needed)  
3. **Open new activity** (clear instruction about starting)

**Verbal Routine:**
- "In 30 seconds, we'll transition to math"
- "Please finish your sentence and close your books"
- "Get your math journal and pencil ready"
- "When I say go, we'll begin problem #1"

**Non-Verbal Signals:**
- Lights off/on = attention needed
- Hand raised = students raise hands too
- Point to schedule = reference what's next

### Group Work Setup

**The Challenge:** Group work becomes chaos without clear procedures

**Before Groups Form:**
1. **Explain the task** clearly (what, how long, expected outcome)
2. **Assign roles** (facilitator, recorder, timekeeper, materials manager)
3. **Set volume level** (whisper, partner voice, or presentation voice)
4. **Share signal** for regrouping (music stops, lights flash)

**Group Formation Strategies:**
- **Clock partners:** Each student has 12 partners (one for each hour)
- **Playing cards:** Same number = group, same suit = pair
- **Puzzle pieces:** Pieces that fit together form groups
- **Teacher choice:** Based on learning needs and social dynamics

### Independent Work Routine

**The Goal:** Students work productively without constant teacher direction

**The Setup:**
1. **Clear expectations** (what to do when finished, noise level)
2. **Help protocol** (ask 3 before me, use help sign)
3. **Materials available** (pencils, paper, references)
4. **Timer visible** (shows how much time remains)

**Help Hierarchy:**
1. **Reread directions**
2. **Ask table partner**
3. **Check class resources** (word wall, reference sheets)
4. **Raise help signal** (colored cup, hand signal)

### Reading/Silent Work

**The Expectation:** True independent engagement

**Components:**
- **Book selection ready** (each student has appropriate book)
- **Reading spot established** (desk, carpet area, reading corner)
- **Silent signal** (no talking, no movement except page turning)
- **Time boundaries** clear (15 minutes, until timer rings)

**Early Finisher Options:**
- Read another book
- Write in reading journal
- Complete silent extension activity
- Review previous assignments

## Management Routines (Week 5-6)

### Bathroom and Water Breaks

**The System:** Minimize disruption while meeting student needs

**Hand Signal Method:**
- 1 finger = bathroom (urgent)
- 2 fingers = water fountain
- Teacher nods = yes, head shake = wait

**Pass System:**
- Only 1 student out at a time
- Take hall pass
- Return within 5 minutes
- No breaks during direct instruction

**Scheduled Breaks:**
- Primary: Every 45-60 minutes
- Secondary: Between class periods
- Emergency protocol for urgent needs

### Supply Management

**The Goal:** Students get what they need without disrupting learning

**Pencil Protocol:**
- Pencil cups at each table
- Broken pencil → trade for working pencil
- Sharpening only at designated times
- Personal pencils stay in desk/backpack

**Materials Distribution:**
- **Materials manager** role for each table
- **Color-coded bins** for different supplies
- **"Take what you need" guideline** (not grab everything)
- **Clean-up signal** to return materials

### Turn-In Procedures

**The Challenge:** Collecting work efficiently without losing papers

**Collection Systems:**
- **Subject bins** labeled clearly (Math, Science, etc.)
- **Table captains** collect and submit
- **Color-coded trays** for different assignments
- **Digital submission** when possible

**Homework Turn-In:**
1. Students place in designated bin during morning routine
2. Homework monitor checks for completion
3. Missing assignments logged immediately
4. Late work has separate location

### Technology Routines

**Device Distribution:**
1. **Row leaders** collect devices
2. **Handle with care** reminder each time
3. **Login immediately** when device is received
4. **Hands off keyboard** until instruction given

**Usage Expectations:**
- Screens down when teacher talking
- One tab/app open at a time
- Help neighbors before calling teacher
- Save work frequently

**End of Session:**
1. **Save and close** all work
2. **Logout completely**
3. **Clean screen** if needed
4. **Return to charging station**

## Advanced Routines (Week 7-8)

### Substitute Teacher Routine

**The Plan:** Your class runs smoothly even when you're away

**Student Jobs:**
- **Class manager:** Explains routines to substitute
- **Schedule keeper:** Tracks timing of activities  
- **Materials helper:** Knows where everything is
- **Technology assistant:** Handles device issues

**Substitute Folder Contents:**
- Class schedule with times
- Student seating chart with helpful notes
- Emergency procedures and contacts
- Behavior management tips specific to your class
- List of reliable student helpers

### Assessment Routines

**Test-Taking Procedures:**
1. **Clear desk completely** except allowed materials
2. **Name and date** on paper first
3. **Read all directions** before beginning
4. **Raise hand** for questions (no talking)
5. **Eyes on own paper** always

**Finished Early Protocol:**
- Review answers quietly
- Read independently
- Complete quiet extension work
- No movement until everyone finishes

### Emergency Routines

**Fire Drill:**
1. **Stop immediately** (leave everything)
2. **Form line** at door quickly and quietly
3. **Follow designated route** (posted by door)
4. **Stay with class** outside
5. **Wait for all-clear** signal

**Lockdown Procedure:**
1. **Lights off** immediately
2. **Move away from windows/door**
3. **Silent and still** until all-clear
4. **Follow teacher directions** exactly

## Building Routine Success

### Teaching Phase (Days 1-10)

**Explicit Instruction:**
1. **Model the routine** step by step
2. **Practice with students** (guided practice)
3. **Explain the "why"** behind each step
4. **Anticipate problems** and address them

**Daily Reinforcement:**
- Practice routines even when unnecessary
- Celebrate successful completion
- Reteach immediately when needed
- Stay consistent with expectations

### Maintenance Phase (Ongoing)

**Gentle Reminders:**
- "Remember our transition routine"
- "Let's practice that again"
- "Who can remind us of step 3?"

**Positive Reinforcement:**
- "I noticed everyone followed our dismissal routine perfectly"
- "Table 4 is ready—great job with materials"
- "Thank you for using our quiet signal"

**Periodic Review:**
- Weekly routine check-ins
- Student feedback on what's working
- Adjust routines that aren't serving their purpose
- Add new routines only when current ones are solid

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Students "forget" routines:**
- Practice more frequently
- Post visual reminders
- Use peer helpers
- Break routine into smaller steps

**Routines take too long:**

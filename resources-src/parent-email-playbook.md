## How to use this pack
1. Copy a **starter**, add specifics, then choose a **closer** that matches the tone.
2. For sensitive topics, start with empathy; keep the focus on the **next step**.

### Starters
- **General update:**  
  *Hi {{Parent/Carer}}, I wanted to share a quick update about {{Student}}'s progress in {{Subject}} this week.*
- **Positive note:**  
  *Hi {{Parent/Carer}}, {{Student}} made a great effort with {{specific}} today—please celebrate this win!*
- **Concern (supportive):**  
  *Hello {{Parent/Carer}}, I'm reaching out to partner with you on {{Student}}'s {{behaviour/work completion}}. Here's what we've tried so far…*

### Closers
- *Thanks for your continued support.*  
- *I'm happy to adjust the plan—please let me know what works at home.*  
- *Let's touch base again on {{date}} to review.*

### Tricky topics (short examples)
- **Late/Incomplete work:**  
  *We're focusing on routines. Our plan: 1) checklist in planner, 2) 10-min start-up, 3) teacher check-in. Could you help reinforce the checklist at home?*
- **Behaviour redirection:**  
  *We're practicing "ready to learn" routines. I'll prompt a short break if needed and reset expectations positively. Any strategies that work well at home?*
- **Sensitive hygiene:**  
  *A quick confidential note: we noticed {{Student}} may benefit from a reminder about {{topic}}. We'll address it discretely at school.*

## AI Assist Prompts (copy/paste)
- "Draft a warm, professional parent email about {{topic}} with a positive tone and a concrete next step. 7–9 sentences."

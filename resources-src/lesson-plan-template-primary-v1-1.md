## The Primary Lesson Flow

### 1. Hook/Warm-up (5-8 minutes)
**Purpose:** Activate prior knowledge and create curiosity

**Effective Hook Ideas:**
- **Real-world problem:** "The school store has 27 pencils. Mrs. Smith brings 35 more. Do we have enough for every student in Year 3?"
- **Quick demo:** Show magic trick, science experiment, or surprising fact
- **Movement activity:** Math facts dance, vocabulary actions, or stretch sequence
- **Mystery box/bag:** Objects related to today's learning
- **Question of the day:** Posted for students to discuss as they enter

**Hook Planning Template:**
```
Hook Activity: _________________________________
Materials Needed: _____________________________
Expected Student Responses: ____________________
Transition Statement: __________________________
```

**Example Hook (Mathematics):**
*Show two piggy banks with play money visible*
"Bank A has 27 pounds, Bank B has 35 pounds. If we combine them, how much money do we have altogether? Talk to your partner about how you'd figure this out."

### 2. Learning Intention & Success Criteria (3-5 minutes)
**Purpose:** Make learning transparent and give students ownership

**Student-Friendly Formats:**
- "Today we will learn..."
- "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to..."
- "Success looks like..."
- "You'll know you've got it when..."

**Success Criteria Examples:**
- ✓ I can solve addition problems step by step
- ✓ I can explain when I need to regroup
- ✓ I can check my answer makes sense
- ✓ I can teach someone else my strategy

<div class="callout note"><strong>Student voice:</strong> Ask "What do you think success will look like?" to build ownership and understanding.</div>

### 3. I Do - Teacher Modeling (8-12 minutes)
**Purpose:** Show clear thinking process and demonstrate skills

**Modeling Checklist:**
- [ ] Think aloud explicitly - show your mental process
- [ ] Use visual supports (board, manipulatives, diagrams)
- [ ] Address common misconceptions proactively
- [ ] Keep students passive but engaged (they watch and listen)
- [ ] Check for basic understanding with simple signals

**Modeling Example (Addition with regrouping):**
"Watch me solve 27 + 35. First, I'll use my blocks to show 27..." *Think aloud through entire process, showing regrouping clearly*

"Let me try another one: 46 + 28. I notice I have more than 10 ones again, so I need to regroup..." *Repeat process with different numbers*

**Common Modeling Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Asking students to participate (save for "We Do")
- Going too fast through steps
- Assuming students see what you see
- Skipping the "why" behind each step

### 4. We Do - Guided Practice (12-18 minutes)
**Purpose:** Practice together with support and feedback

**Guided Practice Strategies:**

| Strategy | How it Works | Best For |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Think-Pair-Share** | Individual thinking → partner discussion → class sharing | All subjects |
| **Choral Response** | Whole class answers together on signal | Math facts, vocabulary |
| **Show Me** | Students use whiteboards/manipulatives to show answers | Math, science concepts |
| **Turn and Teach** | One student explains to partner what we just learned | Checking understanding |
| **Thumbs Check** | Quick confidence check (thumbs up/down/sideways) | Monitoring understanding |

**Guided Practice Example:**
"Now let's try one together: 38 + 26. Everyone get your blocks ready... Show me 38 first... Good! Now what do we add? Show me 26... Now, let's see what happens when we combine them..."

**Differentiation During Guided Practice:**
- **Extra support:** Provide manipulatives, work with teacher aide
- **Challenge:** Ask "What if..." questions, multiple solution methods
- **ELL support:** Visual cues, partner support, key vocabulary displayed

### 5. You Do - Independent Practice (15-20 minutes)
**Purpose:** Apply learning independently to build confidence

**Independent Practice Options:**
- **Individual work:** Worksheets, problem sets, writing tasks
- **Partner activities:** Structured collaboration with defined roles
- **Choice boards:** Multiple ways to practice the same skill
- **Games:** Educational activities that reinforce learning
- **Creative application:** Projects, drawings, real-world problems

**Independent Practice Planning:**
```
Task Description: _____________________________
Instructions (3 steps max): 
1. ______________________________________
2. ______________________________________  
3. ______________________________________

Success Criteria Reminder: ____________________
Support Available: ___________________________
What I'll observe: ____________________________
Early Finisher Activity: ______________________
```

**Teacher Role During Independent Practice:**
- Circulate purposefully, not randomly
- Take anecdotal notes for assessment
- Provide individual feedback and support
- Avoid re-teaching to whole class (save for closure)

### 6. Closure & Assessment (5-10 minutes)
**Purpose:** Consolidate learning and check understanding

**Effective Exit Ticket Options:**

| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **3-2-1** | 3 things learned, 2 questions, 1 connection | All subjects |
| **Problem of the Day** | One problem using today's skill | Math, science |
| **Quick Draw** | Sketch main concept with labels | Science, social studies |
| **Confidence Scale** | Rate understanding 1-4 with evidence | Any subject |
| **Teach Your Pet** | Explain concept as if teaching pet at home | All subjects |

**Closure Example Questions:**
- "What strategy helped you most today?"
- "When might you use this skill outside school?"
- "What was tricky about today's learning?"
- "How is today's learning connected to what we learned yesterday?"

## Assessment Integration

### Formative Assessment Techniques

**Quick Checks (30 seconds - 2 minutes):**
- Thumbs up/down for understanding
- Show fingers 1-5 for confidence level
- Hold up whiteboards with answers
- Traffic light cups (red/yellow/green)

**Medium Checks (3-5 minutes):**
- Exit tickets with 1-2 questions
- Turn and teach to partner
- Quick written explanation
- Draw and label diagram

**Observation Focus Points:**
- Who needs additional support?
- Who's ready for extension?
- What misconceptions are emerging?
- How engaged are students?

### Using Assessment Data Immediately

**During the lesson:**
- Adjust pacing based on student responses
- Provide extra examples if confusion evident
- Offer additional challenges if mastery clear
- Re-teach in different way if needed

**For next lesson:**
- Plan intervention groups
- Adjust difficulty level
- Reteach specific concepts
- Celebrate growth and success

<div class="callout warn"><strong>Important:</strong> Don't wait until tests to discover student difficulties. Use daily formative assessment to guide instruction.</div>

## Time Management Tips

### Pacing Strategies
- Use visual timers for each section
- Plan buffer time for transitions
- Have extension activities ready
- Know what you can cut if running behind

### Transition Techniques
- Use consistent signals (chime, clapping pattern)
- Give 2-minute and 30-second warnings
- Practice routines regularly
- Make expectations clear

### Backup Plans
- Have materials ready for different scenarios
- Prepare shorter/longer versions of activities
- Know which parts are essential vs. nice-to-have
- Keep engaging games ready for unexpected free time

## Technology Integration Ideas

### Low-tech options:
- Document camera for sharing student work
- Audio recordings of student explanations
- Digital timer and music for transitions
- Classroom camera for recording demonstrations

### High-tech options:
- Interactive whiteboard activities
- Student response systems (Kahoot, Padlet)
- Digital manipulatives and simulations
- Video creation for student presentations

<div class="callout tip"><strong>Tech balance:</strong> Technology should enhance learning, not replace hands-on experiences that primary students need.</div>

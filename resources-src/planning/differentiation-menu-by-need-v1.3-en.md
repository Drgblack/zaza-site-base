## Quick Reference Planning Template

**Before the Lesson:**
1. What are my learning objectives?
2. What barriers might prevent student access?
3. What supports can I prepare in advance?
4. How can I offer choice?

**During the Lesson:**
1. Check for understanding frequently
2. Provide wait time for processing
3. Offer additional supports as needed
4. Encourage peer collaboration

**After the Lesson:**
1. What worked well?
2. Who needs additional support?
3. What can I adjust for next time?
4. How did students demonstrate learning?

> **Remember:** Start small and build your differentiation toolkit over time. One new strategy per lesson is manageable and sustainable.

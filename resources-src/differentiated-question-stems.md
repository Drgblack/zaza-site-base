</div>

Transform every lesson with purposeful questions that meet students at their level while challenging them to think more deeply and critically.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Strategic Approach:</strong> Use lower-complexity questions to build confidence, then gradually move to higher levels to stretch thinking without overwhelming learners.
</div>

## The Power of Strategic Questioning

Effective questioning does more than check understandingâ€”it guides thinking, builds connections, and develops critical reasoning skills that transfer across subjects and life situations.

### Cognitive Complexity Levels

This resource organizes questions using research-based complexity levels that build systematically:

| Level | Focus | Student Actions | Example Verbs |
|-------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Level 1: Remember & Understand** | Facts and basic concepts | Recall, recognize, explain | List, define, describe, summarize |
| **Level 2: Apply & Analyze** | Use knowledge in new situations | Solve, categorize, compare | Apply, classify, examine, differentiate |
| **Level 3: Evaluate & Create** | Judge and generate new ideas | Critique, design, synthesize | Evaluate, create, design, formulate |

<div class="callout note">
  <strong>Differentiation Key:</strong> All students engage with higher-level thinking, but entry points and scaffolding vary based on readiness and needs.
</div>

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Struggling Learners

**Scaffold Questions with Supports:**
- Provide sentence starters: "I think... because..."
- Use visual supports alongside questions
- Break complex questions into smaller parts
- Allow processing time before expecting answers
- Offer choice in how to demonstrate thinking

**Level 1 Adaptations:**
- Start with concrete, observable information
- Use familiar contexts and examples
- Provide multiple entry points to the same concept
- Accept varied forms of expression (drawing, gestures, simple words)

**Example Modifications:**
*Complex:* "How do the character's actions reveal their personality traits?"
*Modified:* "What did the character do? How did that make other characters feel?"

### For Advanced Learners

**Add Complexity and Depth:**
- Ask for multiple solutions or perspectives
- Require evidence and justification
- Connect to broader concepts and real-world applications
- Encourage questioning the questions themselves

**Level 3 Extensions:**
- Challenge assumptions and biases
- Require synthesis across multiple sources
- Ask for original solutions to authentic problems
- Encourage peer teaching and mentoring

**Example Extensions:**
*Standard:* "What is the theme of this story?"
*Extended:* "How does this author's treatment of this theme compare to other works we've read? What contemporary issues does this theme illuminate?"

### For English Language Learners

**Language Support Strategies:**
- Use visuals and gestures alongside questions
- Allow native language processing time
- Accept responses in multiple formats
- Provide vocabulary support for key terms
- Model thinking processes explicitly

**Question Modifications:**
- Simplify sentence structure while maintaining rigor
- Provide examples of expected responses
- Use cognates when available
- Allow collaborative responses with peers
- Focus on content understanding over language perfection

## Implementation Strategies

### Planning with Question Stems

<div class="kv">
  <div>**Lesson Preparation**</div><div>Choose 3-5 key questions that build in complexity</div>
  <div>**Student Readiness**</div><div>Plan different entry points for different learners</div>
  <div>**Discussion Flow**</div><div>Sequence questions to guide thinking progressively</div>
  <div>**Assessment Integration**</div><div>Use questions to gauge understanding throughout</div>
</div>

### Creating a Question-Rich Classroom Culture

1. **Model Curiosity:** Share your own wondering and questioning process
2. **Wait Time:** Give students 3-5 seconds to process before expecting answers
3. **Student Questions:** Encourage students to ask questions of each other
4. **No Opt-Out:** Everyone participates, but in ways that match their readiness
5. **Growth Mindset:** Celebrate thinking process over just correct answers

### Building Student Questioning Skills

**Teach Students to Generate Questions:**
- Provide question stem cards for independent use
- Practice turning statements into questions
- Encourage questioning during reading and learning
- Share and discuss the best questions students create
- Use student questions to guide further learning

Remember: Great questions don't just check for understandingâ€”they build it. Every question is an opportunity to develop thinking skills that students will use long after they leave your classroom.

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with API reference and examples
- CLI usage documentation with all commands and options
- TypeScript type definitions for all public APIs
- Code examples for common use cases
- Troubleshooting guide and performance tips

### Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality (>80% coverage)
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Test utilities for file system mocking
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Examples
- **basic-usage.js**: Introduction to library usage
- **forensics-analysis.js**: Advanced forensics workflow
- **data-recovery.js**: Comprehensive recovery example
- Sample data structure for testing

### Configuration
- Environment variable support
- Configuration file support (.salvagerc.json)
- Runtime option validation
- Reasonable defaults for all settings

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Graceful degradation for inaccessible files
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Recovery attempt strategies

### Dependencies
- **commander**: CLI argument parsing and command structure
- **chalk**: Colored terminal output
- **inquirer**: Interactive CLI prompts
- **ora**: Terminal spinners and progress indicators
- **progress**: Progress bars for long operations

### Development Dependencies
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking and compilation
- **Jest**: Testing framework with coverage reporting
- **ESLint**: Code linting and style enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **ts-jest**: TypeScript support for Jest

### Supported Platforms
- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
- Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Both CommonJS and ES modules support

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)

### Security Considerations
- All file paths are validated and sanitized
- Directory traversal protection implemented
- Safe defaults for potentially dangerous operations
- No execution of external commands or scripts
- Minimal external dependencies to reduce attack surface

### Known Limitations
- Deleted file recovery is limited to filesystem capabilities
- Large file processing requires sufficient memory and storage
- Performance dependent on storage speed and file system type
- Some forensics features require elevated privileges

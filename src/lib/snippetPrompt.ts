  4) 1–2 collaborative next steps families can try at home
  5) Invite reply + supportive close

Max is always kind to his classmates and brings such positive energy to our room. Today I noticed he had some trouble staying focused during writing time, which meant he didn't finish his story.

At home, you might try a simple 2-step cue to help him refocus - maybe a gentle hand on his shoulder and a quiet "eyes on your work." This can really help build that focus muscle.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for being such a supportive partner!`

Max always participates so well in our class discussions and shows great thinking. I noticed his math homework wasn't turned in today, and I want to make sure he stays caught up with our learning.

Could you help him set up a simple reminder after dinner to check his backpack? Sometimes that little routine makes all the difference.

Feel free to reach out if there's anything I can do to support at home. Looking forward to hearing from you!`

When Max is here, he settles into our classroom so nicely and gets right to work. I've noticed he's been arriving a bit late recently, which means he misses our morning circle time.

If there are any morning constraints I should know about, please share them with me. We can work together to find solutions that help him start each day strong.

I'm here to support in any way I can. Thanks for your partnership!`

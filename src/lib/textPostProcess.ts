We also noticed a few moments where focus slipped, which makes it harder to start tasks quickly. Could we try a two-step cue at home and school â€“ quick reminder, then a short check-in? Your insights really help. Please reply if there is anything that would make routines easier. Thanks for partnering with me.`);

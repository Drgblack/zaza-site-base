I wanted to touch base about ${studentName}'s recent assignments. They bring such great energy to our classroom discussions and always ask thoughtful questions.

I've noticed a few assignments haven't made it in yet, and I know how busy family life can be! Staying on top of homework can be challenging with everything going on.

Would it help to set up a simple reminder system or adjust the routine? I'm happy to work together to find what works best for your family.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any clarification on assignments or want to chat about support strategies.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Ms. Johnson`;
